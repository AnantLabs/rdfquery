= Introduction =

This project is for plugins for [http://jquery.com/ jQuery] that enable you to generate and manipulate [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ RDF] within web pages. There are two main aims of this project:

  * to provide a way of querying and manipulating RDF triples within Javascript that is as intuitive as jQuery is for querying and manipulating a DOM
  * to provide a way of gleaning RDF from elements within a web page, whether that RDF is represented as [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/ RDFa] or with a [http://microformats.org microformat].

= The Plugins =

Processing RDF embedded within web pages involves using a large number of other technologies that aren't particularly well supported in Javascript or jQuery. Some of these plugins may be useful even if you're not using RDF. The plugins are:

  * `jquery.uri.js` for parsing and resolving URIs
  * `jquery.xmlns.js` for resolving namespaces within HTML pages
  * `jquery.datatype.js` for defining and validating values of different datatypes
  * `jquery.curie.js` for processing [http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/ CURIEs]
  * `jquery.rdf.js` for storing and querying RDF triples
  * `jquery.rdfa.js` for generating RDF triples from RDFa
