= Introduction =

This project is for plugins for [http://jquery.com/ jQuery] that enable you to generate and manipulate [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ RDF] within web pages. There are two main aims of this project:

  * to provide a way of querying and manipulating RDF triples within Javascript that is as intuitive as jQuery is for querying and manipulating a DOM
  * to provide a way of gleaning RDF from elements within a web page, whether that RDF is represented as [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/ RDFa] or with a [http://microformats.org microformat].

If you want to get an idea of what rdfQuery can help you with read this description of [http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/94 using rdfQuery for progressive enhancement of web pages] and take a look at the [http://rdfquery.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/markup/markup.html markup demo] that it describes.

= The Plugins =

Processing RDF embedded within web pages involves using a large number of other technologies that aren't particularly well supported in Javascript or jQuery. Some of these plugins may be useful even if you're not using RDF. The plugins are:

  * [URIPlugin jquery.uri.js] for parsing and resolving URIs
  * [XmlnsPlugin jquery.xmlns.js] for resolving namespaces within HTML pages
  * [DatatypePlugin jquery.datatype.js] for defining and validating values of different datatypes
  * [CuriePlugin jquery.curie.js] for processing [http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/ CURIEs]
  * [RdfPlugin jquery.rdf.js] for storing and querying RDF triples
  * [RdfaPlugin jquery.rdfa.js] for generating RDF triples from RDFa
  * [RdfRulesPlugin jquery.rules.js] for defining rules and reasoning over databanks
